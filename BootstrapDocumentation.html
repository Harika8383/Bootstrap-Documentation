        <pre>
            <h3>What is Bootstrap</h3>
            * Most popular frontend framework.
            * Used for building responsive, mobile first websites and web applications.
            <h3>Why we use Bootstrap?</h3>
            * Increase development speed.
            * Assure responsiveness.
            * Prevent repetition between projects.
            * Ensure cross browser compatibility.
            * Large community.
            * Customizable.
            <h3>Official Website</h3>
            * Current version of bootstrap is 5.3.2.
            * website is getbootstrap.com
            * Scrolling down, we see two links - "Include via CDN". One is for CSS and the other for JavaScript.
            * CDN stands for <b>Content Delivery Network</b>.
            <h3>Advantages of CDN</h3>
            * It maintains different servers depending upon our countries. So the load will be less. So, even when so many peopletries to access it 
              at the same time, the load wont't be on the same server. If we generally download and using a zip file, then the total websitr pressure
              will be directly on us. So the styles applied may take time to load. So, we use CDN links.
            * In CDN link for CSS, it contains all the styles we can to apply.
            <p></p>
            * In bootstrap, we generally use classes to apply styles.
            * <b>Note : </b>We can write as many classes as we want in a single tag, but we need to mention the main-class before applying any sub-classes
              need to mention the main-class to use it.
            <h3>Colors in Bootstrap</h3>
            We have nine different colors in bootstrap. 
            They are - 
                1. primary ==>blue color;
                2. secondary ==> light black;
                3. dark ==> black;
                4. success ==> green;
                5. warning ==> yellow;
                6. danger ==> red;
                7. light ==> no background;
                8. info ==> lightblue.(text will be in black);
                9. link ==> blue color text with blue underline
            <h3>Background Color</h3>
            * main-class for background-color ==> bg
            Ex: bg-primary;
            * To get priority to our style, we apply "!"
            * It gives its most priority to styles that we apply which has "!" symbol before it.
            <h3>button</h3>
            * mian-class ==> .btn
            * When we use btn as a class name, then by default the background-color gray and border(black) will both be removed and only text will 
              appear.
            * By default we will have some margin between buttons. To remove the margin and make it as a group we use class name as <b>btn-group</b>.
            * btn-group must be applied to the parent div.
            * <b>disabled</b> ==> To make a button look inactive
            * <b>btn-sm </b> ==> small button
            * <b>btn-lg </b> ==> large button 
            <h3>Alert Boxes</h3>
            * main-class name for alert box ==> alert.
            * Compared to other classes like buttons or any other classes, alert class colors we apply will be in light color.
            * Text color will be highlighted while the background color will be light.
            * Alert boxes are mainly used for div tags while bnt for button tags. It will work if we apply them to different tags. But, the correct 
              way is to use this way.
            <h3>Height and Width</h3>
            * main class for width ==> w;

                * active ==> To highlight any particular item
            * After applying list-group-item class to the li tag, the content will take entire screen width(block-width) along with border around.
